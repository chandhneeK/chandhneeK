## About Me

My super power is solving problems and data is my trusty sidekick! I am passionate about helping organizations derive insights from data to build great products. I have a demonstrated track record of diving deep and leveraging data to deliver great user experience. My academia and prior work experience have made me skilled at critical thinking and problem solving, skills which are as essential in applying data-driven solutions to business problems. I am well versed in SQL, python, statistics, data analysis through business intelligence tools such as tableau and Power BI, data visualization, data modeling and machine learning. I am currently pursuing Masters in Information Systems at the University of Washington. I have 3+ years of work experience. In my last role, I was a Technical Account Manager at Freshworks Inc. and successfully managed a portfolio of $1.3 Million annual recurring revenue with zero churn using product and customer analytics.
